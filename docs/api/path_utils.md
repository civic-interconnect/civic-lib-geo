# Module `path_utils`

## Classes

### `Path(self, *args, **kwargs)`

PurePath subclass that can make system calls.

Path represents a filesystem path but unlike PurePath, also offers
methods to do system calls on path objects. Depending on your system,
instantiating a Path will return either a PosixPath or a WindowsPath
object. You can also instantiate a PosixPath or WindowsPath directly,
but cannot instantiate a WindowsPath on a POSIX system or vice versa.

## Functions

### `ensure_dir(path: str | pathlib.Path) -> pathlib.Path`

Ensure a directory exists, creating it if necessary.

Args:
    path (str | Path): The directory path to ensure.

Returns:
    Path: The resolved Path object of the directory.

### `safe_filename(name: str) -> str`

Convert a string into a safe, lowercase filename.

Replaces spaces and forward slashes with underscores.

Args:
    name (str): Original string.

Returns:
    str: Sanitized, lowercase filename string.
